    <h2>Some basic information? UM NO MORE LIKE MANDATORY READING</h2>    <p>Hey sassysabbers :) welcome to the official sassysab92 website coded by yours truly, me. This is the home page. no fan websites allowed. if you want to contact me TOO BAD I'M TOO GOOD FOR CONTACT. help i've been isolated on an island for 15 years and i can't escape. On a somewhat more serious note, uh yep I do have a youtube channel. And I'm pretty awesome too (shh don't tell anyone that though.) Anyways I'm following a tutorial online for what to put on my home page so time to add some stuff in like a little bitch who has no creativity.</p>

    <h2>Why my channel is awesome</h2>
    <p>Welp first of all watching my channel videos is mandatory as well. if you don't feel like watching videos... too bad? I also like to think, quite pretentiously, that my videos shall change the world some day. Don't question it :)) For example, my "video game is haunted" video brings attention to an important problem with video games and playing them at 3 am. BECAUSE PLAYING IT AT 3AM OF COURSE MAKES A DIFFERENCE</p>
    <h2>Proof that my channel is loved by everyone</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of fans, squadfam. The most vocal are, of course, my dear friends byodx, floofy, and sheepz. HERE'S SOME PROOF BAEDABBERS! :)</p>
